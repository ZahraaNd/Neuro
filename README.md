This repository is for my work on simulating neuronal networks. I use Hodgkin-Huxley equations to model each neuron, with currents being: Synaptic current, leak current, Potassium current, Sodium current, m current. The differential equations for the membrane potential and the activation functions are solved by 4th-order Runge-Kutta integration. Learning is implemented through firing-rate-dependent STDP, Synaptic Time-Dependent Plasticity. The network is composed of excitatory and inhibitory neurons. The netwrok and its connection are implemented using 'networkx' package. The functions were compiled with the jit decorator from 'numba' package for shorter runtime. 

This work is part of a project that I'm doing for my PhD in which we study the effect of cholinergic modulation, modelled by the changing m-current, on network dynamics and hippocampal replays. This, in turn, fits into the larger goal of understanding the role of the different vigilance states of the brian in learning and memory.
